Welcome to the **PGA 2K25 Build Planner**, a professional-grade Windows application by **CruzLabsStudio**. This tool is designed to solve one of the most time-consuming parts of the game: planning and optimizing your player's build and equipment setup.

Instead of navigating complex in-game menus, use the Build Planner's clean desktop interface to experiment, compare, and find the perfect configuration for your playstyle.

## Key Features

* **Full Build Planning:** Start with a base **Archetype** and distribute up to 150 skill points across all player attributes. The real-time radar chart and stats table instantly show the impact of your choices.
* **Advanced Bag Management:** Configure up to 4 complete golf bags. Select your 14 clubs and apply **Fittings** for each club group, with support for all **Evo Tiers**.
* **Wasted Point Warnings:** The app automatically warns you if any fitting bonuses are wasted because an attribute has hit the 99-point cap, allowing you to optimize your setup perfectly.
* **Powerful Compare Mode:** Load two or more saved profiles (`.json` files) and compare them side-by-side. The app highlights the best stats for an immediate visual analysis.
* **Save & Load Full Profiles:** Save your entire configuration, including your player build and all 4 bags, to a single file.
